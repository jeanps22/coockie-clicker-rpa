# 🍪 Cookie Clicker RPA Project

## Overview
This project involves creating two RPA (Robotic Process Automation) applications using C# to interact with the Cookie Clicker game. The RPAs will use two different frameworks: Selenium Framework and Easy Automation Framework. The goal is to automate the process of clicking the cookie on the Cookie Clicker website [here](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) at a rate of twice per second for 24 hours.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop two RPAs using C#.
- Utilize Selenium Framework for one RPA.
- Utilize Easy Automation Framework for the other RPA.
- Automate the clicking process on the Cookie Clicker website.
- Ensure each RPA clicks twice per second for a duration of 24 hours.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Frameworks**: 
  - Selenium Framework
  - Easy Automation Framework

## 📝 Notes
- Ensure that the website URL and element identifiers (like `bigCookie`) remain unchanged.
- Consider handling potential errors or interruptions during the 24-hour runtime.

## 📈 Expected Outcome
By the end of this project, we will have two robust RPA applications that can automate the Cookie Clicker game, clicking twice per second continuously for 24 hours using different automation frameworks.

Happy Clicking! 🎉🍪
